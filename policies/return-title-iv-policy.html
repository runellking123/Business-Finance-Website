    <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes the procedures for calculating and returning Title IV federal financial aid funds when a student withdraws from Wiley University before completing 60% of the enrollment period. Federal regulations require institutions to determine the amount of Title IV aid "earned" by the student and return any "unearned" funds to the appropriate federal programs.</p>
    <p class="citation">(Reference: 34 CFR 668.22 - Treatment of Title IV Funds When a Student Withdraws; SACSCOC Standard 12.1 - Student Financial Aid)</p>

    <h3>2. Scope</h3>
    <p>This policy applies to all students who:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Received or were eligible to receive Title IV federal financial aid, AND</li>
        <li>Completely withdraw from all courses (officially or unofficially) before completing more than 60% of the enrollment period</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Title IV programs covered by this policy include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Federal Pell Grant</li>
        <li>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)</li>
        <li>Federal Direct Subsidized Loans</li>
        <li>Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans</li>
        <li>Federal Direct PLUS Loans (Parent and Graduate)</li>
        <li>Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant</li>
        <li>TEACH Grant</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Definitions</h3>
    <p><strong>Title IV Funds:</strong> Federal student financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended.</p>
    <p><strong>Withdrawal Date:</strong> The date the student began the official withdrawal process, the last date of academic attendance, or the midpoint of the term for unofficial withdrawals.</p>
    <p><strong>Payment Period:</strong> The semester or term for which Title IV funds were disbursed or could have been disbursed.</p>
    <p><strong>Earned Aid:</strong> The percentage of Title IV aid earned based on the percentage of the payment period completed before withdrawal.</p>
    <p><strong>Unearned Aid:</strong> Title IV funds that must be returned because the student withdrew before earning 100% of the aid.</p>
    <p><strong>Post-Withdrawal Disbursement:</strong> Title IV funds earned by the student but not yet disbursed at the time of withdrawal.</p>

    <h3>4. Policy Statement</h3>
    <p>When a Title IV recipient withdraws during a payment period, Wiley University must determine the amount of Title IV aid earned by the student up to that point. If the student received more aid than was earned, the unearned funds must be returned. If the student received less aid than was earned, they may be eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement.</p>
    <p class="citation">(Reference: 34 CFR 668.22(a) - General requirements for return of Title IV funds)</p>

    <h4>4.1 Determination of Withdrawal Date</h4>
    <p>The withdrawal date is determined as follows:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Withdrawal</th>
                <th>Withdrawal Date</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Official Withdrawal</td>
                <td>Date student began official withdrawal process or last date of attendance, whichever is later</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Unofficial Withdrawal (stopped attending)</td>
                <td>Last documented date of academic activity</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Unofficial Withdrawal (no documentation)</td>
                <td>Midpoint (50%) of the payment period</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Student who does not return from approved leave</td>
                <td>Date the student was scheduled to return</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>4.2 Calculation of Earned Aid</h4>
    <p>The percentage of Title IV aid earned is calculated using the following formula:</p>
    <div class="formula">
        Percentage Earned = Days Attended ÷ Total Days in Payment Period<br><br>
        (Scheduled breaks of 5+ consecutive days are excluded from total days)
    </div>
    <p>If the calculated percentage is greater than 60%, the student has earned 100% of the Title IV aid for that payment period, and no return calculation is required.</p>

    <h4>4.3 Calculation of Unearned Aid</h4>
    <p>When a student withdraws before completing 60% of the payment period:</p>
    <div class="formula">
        Unearned Percentage = 100% - Percentage Earned<br><br>
        Total Aid to Return = Unearned Percentage × Total Title IV Aid Disbursed (or that could have been disbursed)
    </div>

    <h3>5. Procedures</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Registrar's Office notifies Financial Aid of student withdrawal and date</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>9. Special Circumstances</h3>

    <h4>9.1 Modular Courses</h4>
    <p>For programs offered in modules (non-standard terms):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Withdrawal from one module does not trigger R2T4 if student is still enrolled in later module</li>

        <li>If student does not return, R2T4 calculated based on original withdrawal date</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>9.2 Leave of Absence</h4>
    <p>An approved leave of absence does not trigger R2T4 if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Leave does not exceed 180 days in any 12-month period</li>
        <li>Student returns on the scheduled date</li>
        <li>Leave is properly documented and approved</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>9.3 Death of Student</h4>

        <li>No return calculation is required for Title IV grant funds</li>
        <li>Loan debt is discharged according to federal loan regulations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10. Student Notification</h3>
    <p>Students who withdraw are notified in writing of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The amount of Title IV aid earned and unearned</li>
        <li>The amount the University is required to return</li>
        <li>The amount the student is required to return (if any)</li>
        <li>Eligibility for post-withdrawal disbursement (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Any balance due to the University</li>
        <li>Timeframes for repayment</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>11. Examples</h3>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A student withdraws on day 30 of a 100-day semester after receiving $5,000 in Pell Grant and $3,500 in Direct Loans.</p>
    <div class="formula">
        Percentage Earned = 30 ÷ 100 = 30%<br>
        Aid Earned = 30% × $8,500 = $2,550<br>
        Aid to Return = 70% × $8,500 = $5,950
    </div>
    <p>The University and student share responsibility for returning the $5,950 in unearned aid.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A student withdraws on day 65 of a 100-day semester.</p>
    <div class="formula">
        Percentage Earned = 65 ÷ 100 = 65%<br>
        Since 65% > 60%, the student has earned 100% of Title IV aid.<br>
        No return calculation is required.
    </div>

    <h3>12. Compliance and Review</h3>
    <p>This policy is reviewed annually to ensure compliance with 34 CFR 668.22 and other applicable federal regulations.
