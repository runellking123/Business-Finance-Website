    <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes the standards and procedures by which Wiley University monitors the academic progress of students receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid. Federal regulations require institutions participating in Title IV financial aid programs to establish, publish, and apply reasonable standards to measure whether students are maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) toward completion of their academic programs.</p>
    <p class="citation">(Reference: SACSCOC Standard 12.1 - Student Financial Aid; 34 CFR 668.34)</p>

    <h3>2. Scope</h3>
    <p>This policy applies to all students receiving financial aid at Wiley University, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Federal Pell Grants</li>
        <li>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG)</li>
        <li>Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)</li>
        <li>Federal PLUS Loans</li>
        <li>Federal Work-Study</li>
        <li>Texas State Grants and Scholarships</li>
        <li>Institutional Scholarships and Grants</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SAP is evaluated at the end of each semester for all students, regardless of whether they received financial aid during that term.</p>

    <h3>3. Definitions</h3>
    <p><strong>Attempted Hours:</strong> All credit hours for which a student registers, including withdrawals, incompletes, repeated courses, and transfer credits accepted by the University.</p>
    <p><strong>Earned Hours:</strong> Credit hours in which the student received a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P).</p>
    <p><strong>Cumulative GPA:</strong> The grade point average calculated using all attempted coursework at Wiley University.</p>
    <p><strong>Maximum Timeframe:</strong> The maximum period during which a student may receive financial aid, measured in attempted credit hours.</p>
    <p><strong>Financial Aid Warning:</strong> A status assigned to students who fail to meet SAP standards, allowing one additional term of aid eligibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Financial Aid Suspension:</strong> A status indicating loss of financial aid eligibility due to failure to meet SAP requirements.</p>

    <h3>4. Policy Statement</h3>
    <p>To maintain eligibility for financial aid, students must meet all three components of Satisfactory Academic Progress:</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 15px 0 10px 0; font-size: 11pt;">4.1 Qualitative Standard (Cumulative GPA)</h4>
    <p>Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average based on their academic level:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Academic Level</th>
                <th>Minimum Cumulative GPA</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Freshman (0-29 credit hours)</td>
                <td>1.80</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sophomore (30-59 credit hours)</td>
                <td>1.90</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Junior (60-89 credit hours)</td>
                <td>2.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Senior (90+ credit hours)</td>
                <td>2.00</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="citation">(Reference: SACSCOC Standard 12.1 requires institutions to define measurable qualitative standards)</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 15px 0 10px 0; font-size: 11pt;">4.2 Quantitative Standard (Pace of Completion)</h4>
    <p>Students must successfully complete at least 67% of all attempted credit hours. This is calculated by dividing cumulative earned hours by cumulative attempted hours.</p>
    <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> Pace = Earned Hours ÷ Attempted Hours ≥ 67%</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 15px 0 10px 0; font-size: 11pt;">4.3 Maximum Timeframe</h4>
    <p>Students must complete their degree program within 150% of the published program length. For a standard 120-credit-hour bachelor's degree, the maximum timeframe is 180 attempted credit hours. Students who cannot mathematically complete their program within the maximum timeframe become ineligible for financial aid.</p>

    <h3>5. Procedures and Responsibilities</h3>

    <h4 style="margin: 15px 0 10px 0; font-size: 11pt;">5.1 SAP Evaluation Schedule</h4>
    <p>SAP is evaluated at the end of each semester (fall, spring, and summer) after grades are posted. Results are communicated to students via their official Wiley University email within 10 business days of the evaluation.</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 15px 0 10px 0; font-size: 11pt;">5.2 Financial Aid Warning</h4>
    <p>Students who fail to meet SAP standards for the first time are placed on Financial Aid Warning. During this period:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Students may continue to receive financial aid for one semester</li>
        <li>No appeal is required to receive aid during warning status</li>
        <li>Students must meet SAP standards by the end of the warning semester to continue receiving aid</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="margin: 15px 0 10px 0; font-size: 11pt;">5.3 Financial Aid Suspension</h4>
    <p>Students who fail to meet SAP standards after a warning period, or who fail to meet maximum timeframe requirements, are placed on Financial Aid Suspension and are ineligible for federal, state, and institutional aid until SAP standards are met or a successful appeal is approved.</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 15px 0 10px 0; font-size: 11pt;">5.4 Appeal Process</h4>
    <p>Students may appeal Financial Aid Suspension if extenuating circumstances affected their academic performance. Acceptable circumstances include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Serious illness or injury of the student</li>
        <li>Death of an immediate family member</li>
        <li>Other documented extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Appeals must include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Completed SAP Appeal Form</li>
        <li>Personal statement explaining circumstances and plan for improvement</li>
        <li>Supporting documentation (medical records, death certificate, etc.)</li>
        <li>Academic plan developed with an academic advisor (if required)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Appeals are reviewed by the Financial Aid Appeals Committee within 15 business days. Decisions are final for the semester in question.</p>
    <p class="citation">(Reference: 34 CFR 668.34(a)(9) requires institutions to have an appeal process)</p>

    <h4 style="margin: 15px 0 10px 0; font-size: 11pt;">5.5 Financial Aid Probation</h4>
    <p>Students whose appeals are approved are placed on Financial Aid Probation and may receive aid for one semester. Students on probation must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Follow any conditions outlined in their approval letter</li>
        <li>Meet with a financial aid counselor at the beginning of the semester</li>
        <li>Meet SAP standards or their academic plan requirements by the end of the probationary semester</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="margin: 15px 0 10px 0; font-size: 11pt;">5.6 Regaining Eligibility</h4>
    <p>Students on suspension may regain eligibility by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enrolling without financial aid until SAP standards are met, or</li>
        <li>Successfully appealing based on extenuating circumstances</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Treatment of Specific Circumstances</h3>
    <p><strong>Incomplete Grades (I):</strong> Counted as attempted but not earned hours until a final grade is assigned.</p>
    <p><strong>Withdrawals (W):</strong> Counted as attempted but not earned hours.</p>
    <p><strong>Repeated Courses:</strong> All attempts count toward attempted hours; only the most recent grade counts in GPA.</p>
    <p><strong>Transfer Credits:</strong> Accepted credits count toward both attempted and earned hours but do not affect GPA.</p>
    <p><strong>Remedial/Developmental Courses:</strong> Counted in SAP calculations up to 30 credit hours.</p>
    <p><strong>Change of Major:</strong> All attempted hours continue to apply to SAP calculations; students should meet with Financial Aid to discuss impact.</p>

    <h3>7. Compliance and Review</h3>
    <p>This policy is reviewed annually by the Director of Financial Aid and the Senior Vice President for Business & Finance to ensure compliance with federal regulations, state requirements, and SACSCOC accreditation standards.</p>
    <p>The Office of Financial Aid is responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Publishing this policy in the University catalog and on the Financial Aid website</li>
        <li>Notifying students of their SAP status in a timely manner</li>
        <li>Maintaining records of SAP evaluations and appeals</li>
        <li>Training staff on policy implementation</li>
        <li>Reporting compliance data as required by federal and state agencies</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="citation">(Reference: SACSCOC Standard 12.1 requires policies to be published and consistently applied; Standard 12.6 addresses student financial literacy)</p>
